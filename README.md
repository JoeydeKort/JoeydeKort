## Hi, I'm Joey!

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

### üíª About Me
I'm a Java developer who likes to explore new technologies, and take on new and challenging projects. I love the process of creating something from scratch and solving complex problems through code.

### üöÄ My Journey
I changed careers in 2021, going from sales to software development. After completing a full-time one-year program to learn Java, I was offered the position of Java instructor at Intec, the organization where I pursued my training. 

### üî≠ What I'm Working On
Currently, I'm sharpening my skills in Java and Spring.
Here are some of the skills and technologies I work with:
